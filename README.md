### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm happiest when I'm making a difference in projects that matter to me. I love coming up with neat solutions and fixing things up. Right now, I'm diving deeper into full-stack development, primarily with Python and JavaScript.

On the weekends you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, mingling with friends, or exploring an odd thrift shop

Appreciate you stopping by :)
